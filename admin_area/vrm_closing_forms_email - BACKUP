Hello- 
<br><br>
First Title and Escrow is representing the Seller on the above listed transaction. Please check your closing instructions to see who your closing coordinator is at our office. We look forward to working with you for a smooth closing. The following documents are attached to help guide you through the process of preparing for closing and HUD Preparation for the sellers approval.
<br><br>
1. Closing Instructions which include HUD PREP Checklist, JD Prep Deed Order Form, and Tax Worksheet.<br>
2. VRM Signing Authority<br>
3. SAMPLE HUD – Please review<br>
4. Executed Contract Package<br>


<br><br>
**Please put the overnight address for the original executed deed from the seller to your office at the top of the JD Prep Deed order form in special instructions field. (This form also needs to be completed in its entirety)
<br><br>
A copy of your title binder along with the completed deed cover sheet and JDP Deed Form is REQUIRED to be received 10 days prior to the closing date for us to be able to close on time.  Huds must be received in our office a minimum of 48 hours in advance of closing for review and seller approval/signature.  If this is a cash transaction we would like to help you close as soon as possible.  Please contact with any questions.
<br><br>
PLEASE REVIEW THE HUD PREP CHECKLIST IN ITS ENTIRETY.  HUDS WILL NOT BE SUBMITTED TO THE SELLER UNTIL EVERYTHING IS ACCURATE.
VRM will not allow outstanding taxes or HOA dues to be placed on the HUD. They must be paid current and prorated.
Please send any outstanding HOA invoices and TAX invoices to me for payment prior to closing. I will help make sure the agent or seller is paying these POC prior to closing.
<br><br>
Note: Please include asset ##, State and property address in all correspondence. 
<br><br>

Thanks so much. 
<br><br>
FIRST TITLE & ESCROW, INC.<br>
